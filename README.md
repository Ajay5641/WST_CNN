This repository presents the implementation of a deep learning model that classifies motor imagery (MI) tasks from EEG signals. The approach combines the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract robust, translation-invariant features, enabling efficient and accurate MI classification even on limited data.

The model is evaluated on two datasets—BCI Competition IV-2a and DBCIE—and demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art techniques.
